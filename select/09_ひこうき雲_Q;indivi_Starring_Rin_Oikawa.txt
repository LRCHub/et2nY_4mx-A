Laid across a perfect blue sky
A single road of ivory marks its way
So fragile
A glimmer in the sun
As it softly wraps around
Nobody to hold your hand, there all alone
Staring on this lonely path, and climb
With no fear carried in your heart
Soaring high up above

Reaching out up into the sky
Chase the clouds to heavens up high
Hear a whisper as a shadow is
Swept away in the wind

From the window high up above
Standing there before that final day
Staring out up into the sky
Looking for what lies beyond
Nobody can ever know, a tale never told
So very young
And left so suddenly
Remember all that has been lost
And the days of happy memories

Reaching out up into the sky
Chase the clouds to the heavens up high
Hear a whisper as a shadow is
Swept away in the wind

Reaching out up into the sky
Chase the clouds to the heavens up high
Hear a whisper as a shadow is
Swept away in the wind
